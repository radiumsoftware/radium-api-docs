      Many resources have their own feed or timeline. The feed 
      is composed of different activities. Pretty much everything
      in the system generates activities. You can reconstruct these
      activities to create a timeline for each thing in the system.

      And activity can be associated with anything in the system.
      Each one has a timestamp, the user who is responsible for it,
      tags describing it, and the associated objects.

      You can get the feed for any resource you can read. There
      are no interactions with the activities. You may only
      retreive the feed. The server will add the activites to all
      the right feeds. You do not have to worry about any of this.

      Different activites are disscussed in their own section.
      The following sections list the events and their associated tags.

  <section title="Format">
    <docs>
      <![CDATA[
      Acitvities are formatted differently than other resources.
      They have two attributes: `owner` and `reference`.

      There are also `kind` and `tag` attributes. `kind` is what
      type of record it's associated with (todo, contact, or deal etc).
      Then `tag` is used to describe that action happened. It may not always
      be an action, but just a general description of the event.

      There is also a `timestamp` that corresponds to when the 
      action happened. Example, when the email was sent
      or when the contact was added.

      Also, the full objects are given. This is so you can retreive
      the feed and not have to make other request to fetch the associated
      objects. The server assumes you'll need to show the activity
      right away so all the data is given.

      Formats for the `owner` and `reference` follow the formats
      describing their specific sections. The example shows
      an activity done by a user about a todo.
