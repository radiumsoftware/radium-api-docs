      Routing follows RESTful principles. 

      * `POST` means create a resource
      * `PUT` updates a resource
      * `GET` returns one or more resources
      * `DELETE` removes a resource

      `:variable_name` refers to input parameters in the URL.
      The various `:id` parameters are **numeric** only.

      Refer to the individual sections for complete coverage
      of input paramters and output formats.

      Some routes are nested as required. For example, you need 
      an account to create a user, so the route `POST /accounts/:account_id/users`
      reflects that.

      There are also associated routes. For example, you can create
      a todo about a contact usign the `POST /contacts/:contact_id/todos`
      route. This associates the new todo with the specified contact.
