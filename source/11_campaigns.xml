      Campaigns are a way to organize different things in Radium. 
      Putting things in a campaign will allow you generate statistics
      for each one and provide a way to break down your company's performance.

      One user is responsible for each campaign. They can approve
      who get to follow this campaign. They can also add more
      contacts to the campaign.
