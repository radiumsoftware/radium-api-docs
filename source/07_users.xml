      Users are at Radium's core. They are related to all resources
      and do most of the actions in the system. Users are organized
      into teams. Teams have a leader. User's can also follow
      other teams or users to add their activities into their feed.

      ### Deleting Users

      This request may take a while to return depending
      on how many things are associated with this user. Keep
      this in mind when programming.

      **WARNING**: This will DELETE all things they are associated
      with. There is no going back! You **must** reassign all contacts
      before deleting a user, othwerise the delete will fail.
