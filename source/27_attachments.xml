      Attachments are files associated with other objects. Most resources support
      attachments. Creating attachments is a bit tricky due to how file uploads
      are implemented and restrictions on what AJAX can do. In most cases, you 
      want to attach files to things you add to Radium. In order for this to work,
      you must first create the attachment using the API. The API will give you back 
      an ID. Then you can pass that ID with the parent resource when you want to create it.

      There are also API routes to add attachments to existing resources.

      The following resources support attachments:

      1. Contacts
      2. Campaigns
      3. Call Lists
      4. Comments
      5. Deals
      6. Emails
      7. Meetings
      8. Todos
