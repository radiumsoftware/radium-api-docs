      Accounts are like houses. All resources in live in a house. The account is the house.
      You only have access to things inside your account. Accounts are for groups of users.
      They intended for Companies, IE, your company would open an account in Radium then
      add users to it. Usage Based Billing services are billed to the account. The account
      contains billing and credit.

      You are only allowed to manage your own account. You are not allowed to create or delete
      existing accounts. That process is handled by the server.
