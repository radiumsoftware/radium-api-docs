      The API can give you statistics on individual or groups of resources.

      **This functionality is a WIP!** Statisics may be added or removed
      as the application develops. 

      **NOTE**: Date Scoping will be implemented when a final set of statistics 
      has been decided.

      Deal Totals are given as objects divded up into currencies. Sums are
      given in floating point values.
