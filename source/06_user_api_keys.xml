      Users are added by a process on the server. They are authenticated by identities. 
      Identities use emails/password, github, openid, linkedin, google or other OAuth
      providers. You will have to prompt the user to choose their identification method.

      Currently, only email/password are supported with API access. We are still trying
      to determine the best way to integrate OAuth into the API.

      If the login is successful, the response will follow the user format with 
      an extra attribute: `user_api_key`.

      Sending the `user_api_key` parameters is not required for these requests.
