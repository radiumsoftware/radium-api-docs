        <p>The Radium API is designed around <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer">REST</a>.
The API is designed to be predictable and fast. HTTP verbs are used to
indicate what action to do on a particiular resource. HTTP status codes
are use to indicate the results. All response are given back in
<a href="http://www.json.org/">JSON</a>. All requests happen over HTTPS to ensure
security. All requests can be sent either as JSON or as standard URL
encoded form bodies.</p>

<p>The API is designed only allows you act like the user you are logged in
as. System wide access is not allowed. </p>

<p>You will need two things to start using the API.</p>

<ol>
<li>A Developer API key. This is your authentication token. We will
monitor use of this specific token. Every application should have
their own unique token. This token is sent with every HTTP request.</li>
<li>A User API key. This token is globally unique through out Radium.
This allows you to complete actions as the user indentified by this
token. This token never changes. You can use your developer API key
to retreive user API keys.</li>
</ol>

<p>The API is designed to be developer friendly for many different HTTP
clients in any different langauge or framework. You should have no
problem using the API has long as your library can:</p>

<ol>
<li>Send <code>GET</code>, <code>POST</code>, <code>PUT</code>, and <code>DELETE</code> requests</li>
<li>Set headers on individual requests</li>
<li>Conduct HTTP authorization.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now that you know the basic of what you need to use the API&#39;s, let&#39;s go
over developer and user authentication. The server with authorize
requests baised on the resource, user, and action requested. You have no
control over the authorization process. You can simply authenticate to
the server.</p>

<h2>Authentication</h2>

<p>The API has been designed to allow multiple ways to authenticate. It is
designed this way because the authentication information should sent
with every request. Different HTTP libraries allow you to configure them
to do so but in different ways. The API is designed support a few common
scenarios.</p>

<ol>
<li>Authentication by query string paramters. EX:
<code>&#47;foo?developer_api_key=bar&amp;user_api_key=baz</code></li>
<li>HTTP authorization. EX:
<code>https:&#47;&#47;developer_api_key@user_api_key:api.radiumcrm.com</code></li>
<li>Request Headers. EX <code>X-Radium-Developer-API-Key: foo</code></li>
<li>Form body paramters.</li>
</ol>

<p>Refer to your librarie&#39;s documentation to determine which authentication
strategy is right for your application.</p>

<h2>Parameter Parsing</h2>

<p>The API is designed to work these formats:</p>

<ol>
<li><code>application&#47;json</code> <strong>RECOMMENDED</strong></li>
<li><code>application&#47;x-www-form-urlencoded</code></li>
<li><code>multipart&#47;form-data</code> (for uploading Attachments and other files)</li>
</ol>

<p>Sending parameters as JSON encoded objects is the preferred and
recommend way to interact with the API. JSON makes it easier to model
some larger structures required by the API. The examples are also
modeled using a JSON encoded object for input parameters and a JSON
encoded object for output. Your HTTP library should be able to use any
of these formats, however it may not automatically encode JSON for you
so besure you know your HTTP library inside and out!</p>

<h2>HTTP Response Codes</h2>

<p>The API returns status codes to describe what happens for the particular
response. Response codes are listed per individual request as well. 
This section is here to give you a overview of what the API returns and
how to interpert it.</p>

<dl>
  <dt>200</dt>
  <dd>
    <strong>Success</strong><br/>
    Pip-pip jolly good fun ol' bean. Everything went according to plan
  </dd>

  <dt>201</dt>
  <dd>
    <strong>Created</strong><br/>
    Used when a POST to create a resource was successfully
  </dd>

  <dt>202</dt>
  <dd>
    <strong>Accepted</strong><br/>
    Used when a requests enter a queuing system. They are
    processed later and my succeded or fail at that time. If you request
    returns a 202 it should be considered a success.
  </dd>

  <dt>401</dt>
  <dd>
    <strong>Unauthorized</strong><br/>
    Used when could not authenticate using the developer or user token. T
    his is either because the tokens were not provided, provided incorrectly, or simply wrong.
  </dd>

  <dt>402</dt>
  <dd>
    <strong>Payment Required</strong><br/>
    Used when authentication happened correctly, but the request 
    requires a UBB (Usage Based Billing) service that the user
    does not have enough credit for.
  </dd>

  <dt>403</dt>
  <dd><strong>Forbidden</strong><br/> Used when authentication happened correctly, but the
  user does not have access to complete that action on the specific
  resource. Example, try to delete a user from a different account.</dd>

  <dt>404</dt>
  <dd><strong>Not Found</strong><br/> Used when you the specified record could not be found
  in the system. This error will be raised if you try to access records
  outside the scope of the user's account or specify the ID incorrectly.
  Example, specify id is 5 when there is no Todo with id 5.</dd>

  <dt>405</dt>
  <dd><strong>Method Not Allowed</strong><br/> Used when specific URL requires a POST but
  request comes as a GET.</dd>

  <dt>406</dt>
  <dd><strong>Not Acceptable</strong><br/> Used then the API does not know how to generate a
  response for the specified format. Example, requesting XML when the
  API only returns JSON.</dd>

  <dt>422</dt>
  <dd><strong>Unprocessable Entity (aka Validation Failed)</strong><br/> Used for all
  responses that fail to update records for validation reasons or there
  was a problem with the input parameters. See the response body for a
  list of errors.</dd>

  <dt>429</dt>
  <dd><strong>Too Many Requests</strong><br/> Application is over the rate limit for the
  specified developer.</dd>

  <dt>500</dt>
  <dd><strong>Internal Server Error</strong><br/> Returned when an exception is raised on the
  server. This is usually because a bug has occured. 500 responses are
  automatically sent to admins for debugging. This means there is a
  problem with the server and not your application.</dd>

  <dt>502</dt>
  <dd><strong>Bad Gateway</strong><br/> Used when an external server is needed to complete a
  request and it returned an error.</dd>

  <dt>503</dt>
  <dd><strong>Down for maintenance</strong><br/> This is a temporary state.</dd>
</dl>

<h2>Resources</h2>

<p>The API grants you access to all the fundamental resources in Radium.
You should easily be able to use all these resources to create your own
rich Application based off on the Radium platform. I&#39;ll give you
a quick list of all the different things you can access. Refer to the
individual sections for complete indepth disscussion of each resource
and how it relates to the others.</p>

<ol>
<li>Users</li>
<li>Contacts</li>
<li>Groups</li>
<li>Emails</li>
<li>SMS</li>
<li>IM</li>
<li>Todos</li>
<li>Call Lists</li>
<li>Deals</li>
<li>Phone Calls</li>
<li>Meetings</li>
<li>External Accounts (Microsoft Exchange &amp; Google)</li>
<li>Campaigns</li>
<li>Lead Capture</li>
<li>Attachments</li>
<li>Comments</li>
</ol>

<p>Each resource allows for basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete)
operations plus some specific actions for individual resources. For
example, you can CRUD meetings as well as confirm or reject them. Basic
CRUD operations give you (the developer) full control of the lifecyle of
individual records.</p>

<h2>Push Notifications</h2>

<p>The platform will also send push notifications for changes to each
record as well as specific events related to each record. For example,
you may receive a <code>deal_closed</code> event. You can use a <a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/websockets/">Websocket</a>
or a few other socket protocols to connect to the notification server.
You should listen for notifications to keep your application&#39;s data up
to date as it changes in real time. Authentication and listening is
slitghtly different for push notifications. Refer to the push
notification section for indepth discussion.</p>

        <p>This section is here to give you an overview on the data model inside
Radium. You should understand how each different resource interacts with
the others after reading this section. This section will not go in depth
into each resource. Refer to each resource&#39;s section for in depth
coverage. </p>

<h2>Accounts</h2>

<p>All resources are scoped to a specific account. An account is the
container for all things in Radium. Users, contacts, groups, and
everything else all live inside the account. Accounts have owners.
Owners are responsible for paying the bills for each account. Owners may
set permissions for other users related to this account. Enabled
services are stored at the account level. You as the developer never
interact directly with the account. You only access things through the
account. You are not allowed to access things side this account. The
account is your planet and just like man kind you have not unlocked
&quot;travel to different planets.&quot;</p>

<h2>Users</h2>

<p>Users do actions. They send emails, make todos, create campaigns, manage
deals, manage contacts, and create groups. They are essentially
everything! The system is build around users interacting with contacts.
User&#39;s can follow other users, contact, or campaigns. Users are
organized into teams with someone in charge of the team. Users can be in
many teams at once. You are only allowed to manage yourself. If you have
permission you can invite more users into your company&#39;s account. You
can also create deals, record phone calls, messages, add contacts etc. </p>

<h2>Contacts</h2>

<p>Contacts are the core of Radium. Contacts can be anything! They can be
people, they can be companies, they can be organizations. They are
anything you interact with. All resources are somehow related to
contacts. User can request follow contacts to have things related to
them added to their feed. Contacts can be put into multiple groups to
keep them organized. For example, you could organize your contacts into
&quot;Workers&quot; or &quot;Partners.&quot; Contacts also go through the sale pipeline (this
can be configured). Contacts are automatically moved through the
pipeline based on their interactions inside Radium. There is more
discussion on this in the Pipeline section. Contacts must be assigned to
users. The user is responsible for managing them through the sales
process. The user allow approves who can view this particular contact&#39;s
feed. Contacts can be extended with extra fields. You can use extra
fields to add your own particular data to each individual record.</p>

<h2>Groups</h2>

<p>Groups are a way to organize contacts. Groups can also be extended with
extra fields. You <strong>do not</strong> interact directly with groups. You can use
the grouping structure to mimic a Person and Company heirarchy. Groups
are very free form and are only here for to put contacts in arbitrary
groups. Groups are like tags but offer more power since they can be
extended with extra fields.</p>

<h2>Todos</h2>

<p>Todos are very important! Todos have a description and a date to finish
it by. Todos can be associated with <em>anything</em> in the system. Todos can
also have reminders. We also notify you if todos have been reassigned to
you. People are allowed to add todos for other people as well. Users can
also comment on todos. The platform will also associate todos with a
specific contact based on what they&#39;re associated with. For example, if
you make a todo about a meeting with a contact, the todo will be
associated with the specific contact(s). Another example, if you make a
todo about a deal, then the todo will be associated with the deal&#39;s
contact. Todos may also be associated with a campaign. Todos may also
have attachments.</p>

<h2>Deals</h2>

<p>Deals record financial interactions with a particular contact. Deals go
through a these states:</p>

<ol>
<li>Pending</li>
<li>Closed</li>
<li>Paid</li>
<li>Rejected</li>
</ol>

<p>The associated contact will move through the pipeline depending on what
state the deal is. Deals happen with a user and a contact. Deals can
also be a part of a campaign. Deals can also have attachments.</p>

<h2>Messages (Email, SMS &amp; IM)</h2>

<p>Radium can handle many different forms of communication. It can sync SMS
from your phone and send them. It can sync email from your email account
and send email using your account. You can also IM people inside your
own company. Email and SMS can be associated with contacts. IM&#39;s are
only associated with people inside your own company. You cannot IM a
contact. Sending a message to a contact will move them up a stage in the
pipeline. </p>

<h2>Phone Calls</h2>

<p>Phone calls are logged from the user&#39;s mobile device. Phone calls have
specific outcomes which managers can use to track their agent&#39;s success
rate. Phone calls are also associated with call lists. Phone calls
happen between users and contacts. They can either between a user and
another or between a contact and a user. Phone calls can have todos
about them and also be commented on. Calling a contact will move them up
in the pipeline.</p>

<h2>Meetings</h2>

<p>Anyone can add a meeting. You can have a meeting with yourself or you
can choose to invite users or contacts to the meeting. The person who
added the meeting can choose to cancel or reschedule the meeting. If
they do this, everyone invited will receive a confirmation notification.
Individual invitees can decide to confirm or deny their invitation.
Inviting contacts to meetings will move them up in the pipeline.
Meetings can also have attachments.</p>

<h2>Call Lists</h2>

<p>Call Lists contain contacts. Call lists live inside campaigns. All call
lists must have a name and a call by date. You choose to assign a call
list to a user when it&#39;s created. Then, when the calls are made they
will be automatically removed from the call list.</p>

<h2>Campaigns</h2>

<p>Campaigns are a way to group everything else. Contacts, todos, messages,
meetings, and call lists all live inside campaigns. You can add people
to a campaign then create things for it. You need a campaign to create a
call list. Everything else can be associated with a particular campaign.
If you make a todo (or anything else) it can be associated with a
campaign. Campaigns have designated start and ends times. A campaign
also has a specific monetary value it should bring it. This is
calculated from all the deals with contacts in the campaign. Users can
request to follow campaigns. The person in charge of the campaign will
approve these requests. Campaigns also have their own individual
statistics which can be used for reporting.</p>

<h2>Notes, Comments &amp; Attachments</h2>

<p>These resources can be associated with anything. There is
nothing particularly important about them. They are only used to enhance
the associated record. They are public by default.</p>

<h2>Extra Fields</h2>

<p>Extra fields are used to extend individual records. They can be added to
a specific record or all many records at once. They have a type like:
email, phone number or general. You can also specify a set to choose
from. For example you could create an extra field with choices: A, B, C,
and D. That way when a user changes that extra field it will only allow
value that are A, B, C, or D. The email and phone number attributes will
also be used to match phone calls, SMS, and emails to people when
syncing. Extra fields will also be persisted to external accounts when
syncing to those accounts.</p>

<h2>Reminders</h2>

<p>Reminders can be associated with Todos or Meetings. They require a
specific time to be sent. They can be sent via Email or SMS.</p>

<h2>External Accounts</h2>

<p>These are Google or Exchange accounts. Changes that happen in Radium
will be synced back to all the other accounts the user has. Changes that
happen inside these accounts are synced with Radium.</p>

        <p>The pipeline models the progression of a contact. They enter the system
as a <code>lead</code> and either exit the system as a <code>customer</code> or a <code>dead end</code>.
You do not have to manage the pipeline yourself. It happens
automatically based a user&#39;s interaction with that particular person.
The progression through the pipeline is:</p>

<ol>
<li>Lead</li>
<li>Prospect</li>
<li>Opportunity</li>
<li>Customer</li>
<li>Dead End</li>
</ol>

<p>These states are not serial. They can be skipped. Radium will do it&#39;s
best to adapt to all scenarios. Contacts can have their state changed if
people desire. However, the automatically pipeline progression should be
acceptable in most scenarios.</p>

<h2>Leads</h2>

<p><code>Lead</code> is the default state. If a contact is added <strong>without</strong> a state
specified they will be a lead. A lead is someone you have not contacted
or interacted with. A lead represents a chance for your company to make
money. A lead will become a prospect once they are interacted with. This
means, sending them a message, inviting them to a meeting, or making a
todo about them. They can become a dead end if they are uninterested in
whatever your product is. All states can become dead ends at any time.</p>

<h2>Prospects</h2>

<p><code>Prospect</code> means you&#39;ve interacted with this contact some how. They&#39;ve
already been through the lead pool and you&#39;re are actively trying to
start a deal with this person in some fashion. A prospect will become an
<code>opportunity</code> when a deal is added with them.</p>

<h2>Opportunities</h2>

<p><code>Opportunity</code> means there is open deal with this person. They will
either become a customer when the deal is paid or dead end if the deal
is rejected.</p>

<h2>Customers</h2>

<p><code>Customer</code> is the happy state. This means they&#39;ve bought whatever your
selling and now it is up to you to follow up with them or do whatever
your organization requires to retain them.</p>

<h2>Dead Ends</h2>

<p><code>Dead Ends</code> are people who are not interested in your product(s) at all.
They should not be contacted again. For all intensive purposes, you can
consider them removed from the system. </p>

<h2>Statistics &amp; Reports</h2>

<p>Progression through the pipeline is automatically tracked by Radium.
Radium will use this information to generate all sorts of fancy reports
(including charts and graphs!) for pipeline states at arbitrary times. We
are here for all your enterprise needs! (including charts and graphs).</p>
