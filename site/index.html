              <p>The Radium API is designed around <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer">REST</a>.
The API is designed to be predictable and fast. HTTP verbs are used to
indicate what action to do on a particiular resource. HTTP status codes
are use to indicate the results. All response are given back in
<a href="http://www.json.org/">JSON</a>. All requests happen over HTTPS to ensure
security. All requests can be sent either as JSON or as standard URL
encoded form bodies.</p>

<p>The API allows you act like the user you are logged in
as. System wide access is not allowed.</p>

<p>You will need two things to start using the API.</p>

<ol>
<li>A Developer API key. This is your authentication token. We will
monitor use of this specific token. Every application should have
a unique token. This token is sent with every HTTP request.</li>
<li>A User API key. This token is globally unique through out Radium.
This allows you to complete actions as the user indentified by this
token. This token never changes. You can use your developer API key
to retreive user API keys.</li>
</ol>

<p>The API is designed to be developer friendly for many different HTTP
clients in any different langauge or framework. You should have no
problem using the API has long as your library can:</p>

<ol>
<li>Send <code>GET</code>, <code>POST</code>, <code>PUT</code>, and <code>DELETE</code> requests</li>
<li>Set headers on individual requests</li>
<li>Conduct HTTP authorization.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now that you know the basics, let&#39;s go
over developer and user authentication. The server will authorize
requests based on the resource, user, and action requested. You have no
control over the authorization process. You can simply authenticate to
the server.</p>

              <h2 id="s-authentication">Authentication</h2>

              <p>The API has been designed to allow multiple ways to authenticate. It is
designed this way because the authentication information should sent
with every request. Different HTTP libraries allow you to configure them
to do so but in different ways. The API is designed support a few common
scenarios.</p>

<ol>
<li>Authentication by query string paramters. EX:
<code>&#47;foo?developer_api_key=bar&amp;user_api_key=baz</code></li>
<li>HTTP authorization. EX:
<code>https:&#47;&#47;developer_api_key@user_api_key:api.radiumcrm.com</code></li>
<li>Request Headers. EX <code>X-Radium-Developer-API-Key: foo</code></li>
<li>Form body paramters.</li>
</ol>

<p>Refer to your library&#39;s documentation to determine which authentication
strategy is right for your application.</p>

              <h2 id="s-parameter-parsing">Parameter Parsing</h2>

              <p>The API is designed to work these formats:</p>

<ol>
<li><code>application&#47;json</code> <strong>RECOMMENDED</strong></li>
<li><code>application&#47;x-www-form-urlencoded</code></li>
<li><code>multipart&#47;form-data</code> (for uploading Attachments and other files)</li>
</ol>

<p>Sending parameters as JSON encoded objects is the preferred and
recommend way to interact with the API. JSON makes it easier to model
some larger structures required by the API. The examples are also
modeled using JSON input and JSON
output. Your HTTP library should be able to use any
of these formats, however it may not automatically encode JSON for you
so be sure you know your HTTP library inside and out!</p>

<dl>
  <dt>200</dt>
  <dd>
    <strong>Success</strong><br/>
    Pip-pip, jolly good fun ol' bean. Everything went according to plan
  </dd>

  <dt>201</dt>
  <dd>
    <strong>Created</strong><br/>
    Used when a POST to create a resource was successful
  </dd>

  <dt>202</dt>
  <dd>
    <strong>Accepted</strong><br/>
    Used when a requests enter a queuing system. They are
    processed later and my succeded or fail at that time. If you request
    returns a 202 it should be considered a success.
  </dd>

  <dt>401</dt>
  <dd>
    <strong>Unauthorized</strong><br/>
    Could not authenticate using the developer or user token.
    This is either because the tokens were not provided, provided incorrectly, or simply wrong.
  </dd>

  <dt>402</dt>
  <dd>
    <strong>Payment Required</strong><br/>
    Used when authentication worked, but the request 
    requires a UBB (Usage Based Billing) service that the user
    does not have enough credit for.
  </dd>

  <dt>403</dt>
  <dd>
    <strong>Forbidden</strong><br/>
    Used when authentication happened correctly, but the
    user does not have authorization to complete that action on the specific
    resource. Example, try to delete a user from a different account.
  </dd>

  <dt>404</dt>
  <dd>
    <strong>Not Found</strong><br/>
    Used when you the specified record could not be found
    in the system. This error will be raised if you try to access records
    outside the scope of the user's account or specify the ID incorrectly.
    Example, specify id is 5 when there is no Todo with id 5.
  </dd>

  <dt>405</dt>
  <dd>
    <strong>Method Not Allowed</strong><br/>
    Used when specific URL requires a POST but request comes as a GET.
  </dd>

  <dt>406</dt>
  <dd>
    <strong>Not Acceptable</strong><br/>
    Used then the API does not know how to generate a
    response for the specified format. Example, requesting XML when the
    API only returns JSON.
  </dd>

  <dt>422</dt>
  <dd>
    <strong>Unprocessable Entity (aka Validation Failed)</strong><br/>
    Used for all responses where the associated resource fails validation.
    For example, you tried to create a user but forgot to specify the email address.
    See the response body for a list of errors.
  </dd>

  <dt>429</dt>
  <dd>
    <strong>Too Many Requests</strong><br/>
    Application is over the rate limit.
  </dd>

  <dt>500</dt>
  <dd>
    <strong>Internal Server Error</strong><br/>
    Returned when an exception is raised on the
    server. This is usually because a bug has occured. 500 responses are
    automatically sent to admins for debugging. This means there is a
    problem with the server and not your application.
  </dd>

  <dt>502</dt>
  <dd>
    <strong>Bad Gateway</strong><br/>
    Used when an external server is needed to complete a request and it returned an error.
  </dd>

  <dt>503</dt>
  <dd>
    <strong>Down for maintenance</strong><br/>
    This is a temporary state.

              <p>The API grants you access to all the fundamental resources in Radium.
You should easily be able to use all these resources to create your own
rich Application based off on the Radium platform. I&#39;ll give you
a quick list of all the different things you can access. Refer to the
individual sections for complete indepth disscussion of each resource
and how it relates to the others.</p>

<ol>
<li>Users</li>
<li>Contacts</li>
<li>Groups</li>
<li>Emails</li>
<li>SMS</li>
<li>IM</li>
<li>Todos</li>
<li>Call Lists</li>
<li>Deals</li>
<li>Phone Calls</li>
<li>Meetings</li>
<li>External Accounts (Microsoft Exchange &amp; Google)</li>
<li>Campaigns</li>
<li>Call Lists</li>
<li>Lead Capture</li>
<li>Attachments</li>
<li>Comments</li>
</ol>

<p>Each resource allows for basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete)
operations plus some specific actions for individual resources. For
example, you can CRUD meetings as well as confirm or reject them. Basic
CRUD operations give you (the developer) full control of the lifecyle of
individual records.</p>

              <p>The platform will also send push notifications for changes to each
record as well as specific events related to each record. For example,
you may receive a <code>deal_closed</code> event. You can use a <a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/websockets/">Websocket</a>
or a few other socket protocols to connect to the notification server.
You should listen for notifications to keep your application&#39;s data up
to date as it changes in real time. Authentication and listening is
slightly different for push notifications. Refer to the push
notification section for indepth discussion.</p>

              <p>Routing follows RESTful principles. </p>

<ul>
<li><code>POST</code> means create a resource</li>
<li><code>PUT</code> updates a resource</li>
<li><code>GET</code> returns one or more resources</li>
<li><code>DELETE</code> removes a resource</li>
</ul>

<p><code>:variable_name</code> refers to input parameters in the URL.
The various <code>:id</code> parameters are <strong>numeric</strong> only.</p>

<p>Refer to the individual sections for complete coverage
of input paramters and output formats.</p>

<p>Some routes are nested as required. For example, you need 
an account to create a user, so the route <code>POST &#47;accounts&#47;:account_id&#47;users</code>
reflects that.</p>

<p>There are also associated routes. For example, you can create
a todo about a contact usign the <code>POST &#47;contacts&#47;:contact_id&#47;todos</code>
route. This associates the new todo with the specified contact.</p>

everything! The system is build around users interacting with contacts.
User&#39;s can follow other users, contact, or campaigns. Users are
organized into teams with someone in charge of the team. Users can be in
many teams at once. You are only allowed to manage yourself. If you have
permission you can invite more users into your company&#39;s account. You

people, they can be companies, they can be organizations. They are
anything you interact with. All resources are somehow related to
contacts. User can request follow contacts to have things related to
them added to their feed. Contacts can be put into multiple groups to
keep them organized. For example, you could organize your contacts into
&quot;Workers&quot; or &quot;Partners.&quot; Contacts also go through the sale pipeline (this
can be configured). Contacts are automatically moved through the
pipeline based on their interactions inside Radium. There is more
discussion on this in the Pipeline section. Contacts must be assigned to
users. The user is responsible for managing them through the sales
process. The user allow approves who can view this particular contact&#39;s
feed. Contacts can be extended with extra fields. You can use extra
fields to add your own particular data to each individual record.</p>

you. People are allowed to add todos for other people as well. Users can
also comment on todos. The platform will also associate todos with a
specific contact based on what they&#39;re associated with. For example, if
you make a todo about a meeting with a contact, the todo will be
associated with the specific contact(s). Another example, if you make a
todo about a deal, then the todo will be associated with the deal&#39;s
contact. Todos may also be associated with a campaign. Todos may also

              <p>Developers must authenticate themselves and the user by supplying API keys for <strong>every</strong> request.</p>

<p>You (the developer) are assigned an API key. This never changes unless there is a very serious 
reason. One of the Radium admins will issue you a key upon request. If you are developing
multiple applications on the Radium platform, you should use a unique key for every application.
This will allow us and you to track your individual applications and handle them separately. </p>

<p>You will need to retreive a user&#39;s API key in order for them to use your application.
This means the user must login to our platform and thusly your application. This is the only 
request <strong>that does not require a user api key</strong>.</p>

<p>The next sections will cover how to authenticate using three different methods.
Choose which ever one makes developing your application easier. These parameters 
must be sent with every request so make sure the method is configurable with your individual
HTTP library.</p>

<p>You must choose <strong>one</strong> way to authenticate. The server tries to authenticate each request in
in this order:</p>

<ol>
<li>Headers</li>
<li>HTTP Authentication</li>
<li>Query&#47;Form Parameters</li>

This request can be presented in URL form: <code>http:&#47;&#47;developer_api_key:user_api_key@www.example.com&#47;</code></p>

              <h2>Testing Your Login</h2>

<p>You can also test your code by using the echo service. This route acts exactly
like all the others except it does not check the user api key and it always returns
whatever you sent it. You can use this to test that you&#39;re sending the developer API
key correctly and your request parameters are being interperted correctly. </p>

                <p><code>POST https:&#47;&#47;api.radiumcrm.com&#47;echo</code></p>

anything on the server.</p>
